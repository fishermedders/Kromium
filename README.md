# Kromium, the Krist Browser

A web browser designed to be used with [Krist](https://krist.ceriat.net/). Set your 'A' Records in [Krist.club](https://krist.club/) to view your domains!

In the future there will be more Krist oriented features implemented (address info, donations through browser, 3rd party browser wallets, etc.)

## Development

If you wish to contribute, build the project by doing so:
`git clone https://github.com/fishermedders/Kromium`
`cd Kromium`
`npm i`
`npm start`

# Test the browser by going to **kristconsole.kst**
